# MagNET_thesis
My attempt to make a thesis out of the MagNET database

Run $python3 main.py to execute the code
BE CAREFUL: If you change the DATA_SUBSET_SIZE hyperparameter the first time you run the code you also have to change the 
            hyperparameter USE_CACHED_SCALOGRAMS to FALSE


This repository is still a work in progress.
